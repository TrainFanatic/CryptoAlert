NOTE 1: USING THE PASTE UTITLITY TO MAKE LIFE EASIER
Here are some notes:
Using the `paste' ability, I was able to turn file filtered3 into file filtered5
It turns the file containing the series of:

	id
	name

into:

	id:name

This is extremely helpful because it is hard to find a way to call id and name as pair in the first format, while in the second format, you can do it by simply doing `cat file |  cut -d: -f$i' where $i is 1 for id and 2 for name
This was done by doing:

	cat filtered3 | paste -d ':' - - > filtered5

The file filtered4 was made sheepishly (and sort of dumbly) by doing these two commands

	cat filtered3 | paste -d ' ' - - > filtered4
	cat filtered4 | tr ' ' ':' > filtered5
or similarly, instead of doing the second command (cat | tr)
	tr ' ' ':' < filtered4 > filtered5
